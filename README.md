# Statistical-Analysis-of-Student-Grades

Description:

The task involves processing a dataset represented as an array of JSON objects, where each object corresponds to a student and contains their grades in different subjects. Each student's information is structured with a "name" field (string) and a "grades" field (list of objects with "subject" and "grade" fields). The objective is to create a Python (or Java) function that performs the following calculations:

Calculate the average grade for each student.
Compute the average grade for each subject across all students.
Determine the overall average grade across all students.
Calculate the standard deviation of grades across all students.
The function takes the array of JSON objects as input and returns a dictionary (in Python) or an object (in Java) containing the computed statistics, including individual student averages, subject averages, overall average, and standard deviation. The focus is on the statistical analysis of the provided data structure.
